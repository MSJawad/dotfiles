# @MSJawad's dotfiles

After around a year of messing about with distros, config files and vimscripts and stuff i think im finally comfy rn with the setup. using i3-gaps WM and lightweight vim customized for cpp and node.js. Gonna try to do a few node.js projects, as well as learn Golang by the side. the latter will involve a ton of additions to the current dotfiles

# Inspiration

The dude in the comment's section screaming 'I use arch btw' to everyone who will listen. Jk lightweight Fedora manz here. Maybe ill mess with Manjaro if i have a ton of time to myself and cant think of a project to mess around with(not likely).
Also friends who tolerate my obsession with opaque background terminals.

# Setup

no setup configuration right now :(. Hoping to make one when work/school doesnt have a vice grip on me, and projects are finished(a little more likely than Manjaro but not by much)
